smallpaint by karoly zsolnai - zsolnai@cg.tuwien.ac.at

render, modify, create new scenes, tinker around, and most of all:
have fun!

This program is used as an educational learning tool on the Rendering
course at TU Wien. Course webpage:

This UI serves as an educational learning tool to see the progressions
and experience the different renderes with different input.

Executables for Windows and Linux are provided in the folders "binary_win32"
and "binary_linux". If changes were made to the source code, rebuilding the 
solutions is necessary:
				
Building (Windows):
	- If you didn't already: Download and install Qt (tested with Version 5.10):
				- Qt: https://www.qt.io/download
	- Delete everything from the "binary_win32" folder.
	- Open the "Smallpaint.pro" file with the Qt Creator.
	- Go to the Build Settings and edit the build configuration (i.e., set to Release)
	- Change the build directory to the path of "binary_win32".
	- Build the project.
	- Remove everything, but the "Smallpaint.exe".
	- Open a console and call the command: 
				%PATH_TO_QT_KIT%\windeployqt.exe . 				(the dot is important)
	- If you are missing some dependencies look for them in the dependecy folder or online.

Building (Linux):
	- If you didn't already: Download and install Qt (tested with Version 5.10):
				- Qt: https://www.qt.io/download
	- Remove everything in the "binary_linux" folder and open a terminal there.
	- Call the commands:
				%PATHTOQT%/Qt5.7.0/5.7/gcc_64/bin/qmake ../src_gui
				make -j4
	- If you're missing some dependencies, run "ldd %PROGRAM%" and see what it links to.
